  - OpenAI-compatible APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
  - Apple Foundation Models (on-device, privacy-focused, requires macOS 15+).
- 🖱️ **Finder Extension**: Right-click any folder in Finder to instantly start the organization process.
- 🔗 **App-Wide Deeplinks**: Control the app externally via `sorty://` URL schemes for automation and shortcuts.
- ⌨️ **CLI Tooling**: A companion command-line tool `learnings` for managing organization projects and analysis from the terminal.
- 👁️ **Interactive Preview**: Review and tweak suggested organization before any files are moved.
- 🗂️ **Organization History**: Track all operations with detailed analytics, reasoning, and rollback support.
- 🛡️ **Safe by Design**: Includes dry-run modes, comprehensive validation, duplicate protection settings, and exclusion rules.
