# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security vulnerability, please report it via GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting mechanism.

Please refrain from disclosing security vulnerabilities in public issues.

### Disclosure Process

Once a report is received, the maintainers will verify the issue and respond with a proposed timeline for remediation. We request that you provide sufficient time to address the vulnerability before public disclosure.

### Bug Bounty Program

This project is a community-driven initiative. At this time, we do not offer a monetary bug bounty program. We value the contributions of security researchers and will provide appropriate attribution for verified reports.
